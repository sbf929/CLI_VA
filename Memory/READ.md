Capture and Preprocess User Command:

Capture: Obtain the command from the user.
Preprocess: Clean and preprocess the command text (e.g., tokenization, normalization).
Store Command Using Memory Classes:

Create Memory Instances: Based on the type of command (e.g., personal, task, information), create instances of the appropriate memory class.
Store in Database: Use the methods in your BaseMemory class to insert or update memory entries in the database.
Retrieve and Use Memory:

Retrieve Relevant Memories: When a new command comes in, query the database for relevant memories based on the context or keywords.
Process and Utilize: Use the retrieved information to provide a relevant and accurate response.
Maintain and Update Memory:

Update: Regularly update existing memory entries as new information is stored.
Process: Process memory data to keep it organized and useful.
Implementation Steps:
Command Handling:

Implement methods to preprocess commands and categorize them.
Memory Storage:

Design and implement classes for different types of memories (personal_memory, task_memory, info_memory).
Implement methods to create, update, and manage database entries.
Memory Retrieval:

Implement methods to query and retrieve relevant memories.
Ensure efficient querying based on the command context.
Response Generation:

Utilize the retrieved memory data to generate responses to user commands.
This approach will allow you to build a dynamic memory system that can handle various types of information and respond intelligently based on past interactions. If you need further assistance with specific implementations or have any questions, feel free to ask!
